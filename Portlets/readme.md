# Portlets

These are not templates used in Collection Definition > Display but to display "portlets" on the dashboard, they can be edited and deleted on the /access/portaladmin.do page.

While we should avoid absolute URL references elsewhere (no "https://vault.cca.edu" on the front of everything), in the portlets it is probably necessary to use absolute URLs. Many URLs reference assets stored inside VAULT itself so if we move the code to our development instance, the URLs will point to nonexistent resources.

Note that portlets can also have CSS files loaded in their settings.
