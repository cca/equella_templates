# VAULT Display Templates

These are the Freemarker templates used in the Display tab of VAULT collections.

Note: the set may not be complete and there's nothing stopping us from editing live templates without updating them here.

## Grunt

Grunt tasks automate some tedious work. Once you have node, npm, and grunt installed and on your path , run `grunt` to build optimized web assets into the "dist" folder.
